# TiDB Insight

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/pingcap/tidb-insight)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/pingcap/tidb-insight)

TiDB Insight is a set of tools and/or scripts to collect information and metrics from all nodes of a TiDB cluster. The data is collected and archived to a tarball so that one can copy the data anywhere for further investigation.

TiDB Insight is designed to help you troubleshoot and diagnose machines within a TiDB cluster when you don't have access to the cluster.

## Collector

The `collector` is a simple binary tool written in Go that collects various kinds of server information, including system information, TiDB/TiKV/PD versions, etc.

`collector` prints a JSON to stdout.

## Scripts

WIP: The scripts to call other tools (e.g., `collector`) and organize their results.

The `insight.py` file is the entrance of all scripts. It calls `collector` to collect basic information and then trigger other tools to gather more data.

It is recommended to run this script with the root privilege.

The following features have been implemented:

 - Record `perf` data of the whole system, TiDB modules, or specific process. (disabled by default)
 - Check the file size of TiDB modules' data directories. (disabled by default)
 - Collect and save log files of TiDB modules or system. (disabled by default)
 - Collect and save various configuration files of system. (disabled by default)
 - Query PD API to collect runtime information of the TiDB cluster. (disabled by default)
 - Record `direct reclaim latency` data of the whole system. (disabled by default)
   When the system has low memory remaining, and `watch -n 1 -d "cat /proc/vmstat | grep allocstall"`
   continues to grow, and the processes latencies are higher than usual, you should enable it.
 - Record the loading of a file or all files in a path in the page cache. (disabled by default)
   When the system's page cache is used too much, you can enable it.
 - Record `block IO latency` data of the disk. (disabled by default)

Note that some arguments may decrease system performance.
```

If `insight.py` is called with no argument provided, the following information is collected and saved to `data` directory in the current working directory:

 - `collector`, which provides the system information, program versions, NTP status, partition statistics and process statistics of TiDB modules (if present), placed in the `collector` sub-directory.
 - PD API output of `config`, `diagnose`, `health`, `hotspot`, `labels`, `members`, `operators`, `regions`, `regionstats`, `schedulers` and `status`, placed in the `pdctl` sub-directory in JSON format.

Using `-o` can set another location to store output data except the default `data`.

### Examples

Take `insight.py -l --config-file`, a common combination of arguments as an example. It is used to collect the basic system information, TiDB modules' log files and several config files.

If you want to collect runtime information of a TiDB cluster from PD on a remote host (instead of running the scripts on that server), set `--pd-host` to the IP address or a resolvable hostname of that host. Additionally, if PD is listening on non-default port, use `--pd-port` to set it.

The system log is not collectd by default, even if `-l` is set. If needed, use `-l --syslog` to enable it. Both `syslog` and `systemd-journald` logs are supported and automatically detected. Note that there is no content filter available for log files, thus enabling log file collecting may lead to a very large output size.

## Intergration with Ansible

The `tidb-insight` project is designed to intergrate with [tidb-ansible](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-ansible) playbooks.

> All collecting features will be disabled by default after the development of intergration is finished, so it's highly recommended to specify all the arguments needed when using `tidb-insight` now, even if the feature is currently enabled by default.

The `tidb-insight` tarball is included in `tidb-ansible` as part of playbook `collect_diagnosis`, it deploys the pre-build `tidb-insight` dependencies and tools, as well as scripts to the target server. Several tasks can be called directly from `ansible-playbook` such as collecting log files of all deployed TiDB/TiKV/PD instances (While `--log-auto` of `tidb-insight` only collects log files of running processes), and copy them back to the controller server in `.tar.gz` format.

There might be features that are not yet implemented or enabled in `tidb-ansible`. Users can login to the target server to call `tidb-insight` and execute these features by hand. The package is located at `deploy/scripts/tidb-insight` on the target server.

## Insight

TO DO: Create the analysis tool that helps process dataset.
